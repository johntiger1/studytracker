Lessons:
documentgetelementbyID to interface between javascript and html
lots of firebase intricacies (for example, can only have one "type" of data (so that having "date" and "start" and "end" will not work))
need to firebase login and such as well

prototype is the JS way of classes and such
after doing this, this.study_stop = document.getElementById('button2');
can modify many things about it! For example, make it hidden, make it larger etc.
